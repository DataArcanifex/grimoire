        <p>Being human is being <strong>immersed</strong> in a world of symbol and meaning. Through understanding this reality
        Trenton R. Pennington began to grow into storycraft and word magic.<br>
        Inspired by the tradition of telling stories aloud, Trenton explored the use of prose poetry in telling
        fantasy stories.</p>
<hr width="60px">
        <p class="intro">Here's a glimpse of the magic he weaves:</p>
        
        <em><p class="flavor">"Wooded silence returned, tree-frogs shrieking in summer’s last for mates not won, spawn lost to fate and circumstance. 
            In grey-light gloaming saw she the babe's eyes focus, steady, without sound, without the grimace most showed when meeting her time-washed face.</p></em>          
            <p></p>
            <em><p class="flavor">"Ye're a boy, eh?" she noted identifying flesh, "Boys want not for being wanted," said she, wrapping cold boy in old cloak. As the swaddling came tight so too came another wordless locking of eyes, fresh to worn, and she wondered if perhaps the web of wyrd was naught but a petulant child."
            </p></em>
            <p></p>
<hr width="60px">
        <p>With a hypnotic, trance-inducing command of the English language, Trenton weaves tales that beg to be shared, told aloud, and heard.<br>
        Clever wordsmithing brings refreshing views of how stories might have been told, how fairy tales might even now be told.<br>
        With a delicate balance of rhythm, rhyme, and imagery, his stories bring you into the world of Middelgarren.<br>
