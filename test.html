        <article>This is a test article to see what happens <br>
        when I place an article inside a divider tag. This divider<br>
        is outside of the body tag. It seems that body styling applies<br>
        to article elements unless the article element is styled explicitly.</article>

        <p>This can seem overwhelming sometimes. There is a lot to learn, after all!<br>
        But I choose to persevere. I want to master these skills.<br>
        I will become a great web developer, because I want to be great!</p>
